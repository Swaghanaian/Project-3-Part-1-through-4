But when Griffin moves into Joel's inner circle, Joel must quickly find some way to stop him before someone close to him becomes the next one to die.",16.04,/z4PjLZa3Eizu6bNFAatmk88yrG4.jpg,"[{'id': 33, 'logo_path': '/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png', 'name': 'Universal Pictures', 'origin_country': 'US'}, {'id': 2016, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Interlight', 'origin_country': ''}, {'id': 143567, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Lewitt / Eberts Productions', 'origin_country': ''}, {'id': 143568, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Choi / Niami Productions', 'origin_country': ''}, {'id': 143569, 'logo_path': None, 'name': 'Driven Productions', 'origin_country': ''}]","[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2000-09-08,0.0,96.0,"[{'english_name': 'Vietnamese', 'iso_639_1': 'vi', 'name': 'Tiếng Việt'}, {'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,Don't go home alone.,The Watcher,0.0,4.964,400.0,R

We then track the events of the evening as the news affects each person in turn. Instead of the absolute approval Ross and Beth had hoped for, the news throws a harsh spotlight on everyone's relationship and notions of marriage. The film explores the confused attitudes of a generation whose model of love and romance is complex and demanding.

A New York City native, Watson isn't much of a driver, and her over-protective mother forces her to buy a car she can't afford - a brand new Volvo. Watson falls in love with the car, but real life quickly catches up to her in the form of the repo man when she falls behind on her monthly payments. To avoid losing her beloved wheels, Watson tries her hand at two of the oldest professions: waiting tables and phone sex. At the same time, her meddling best friend (Jamie Harrold), convinces Watson to ignite her stagnant love life by pursuing a sexually-phobic pilot (Gabriel Macht) and an aloof supermarket cashier (Glenn Fitzgerald). The result is a refreshing comedy packed with star cast performances and an overriding moral: life's long and winding road has as many speed bumps as straightaways.",0.84,/qQA95FP6TGHDaLvXbYUQi8dUMRH.jpg,[],[],2000-01-01,0.0,100.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,101 Ways (The Things a Girl Will Do to Keep Her Volvo),0.0,5.0,1.0,

A junkie who gets clean, a stroke survivor, a liberal rabbi, a band leader named ""Dethy,"" an old black man named Simon and a transvestite who has survived the AIDS epidemic are just some of the characters who color the film.
